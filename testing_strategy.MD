Common API Testing Scenarios
Basic Functionality Tests:

GET requests: Ensure the API correctly returns data. Test for different endpoints and ensure the status codes are correct (e.g., 200 OK).
POST requests: Test to confirm that data is correctly created. Check if the response returns the right status code (201 Created) and verifies the data format.
PUT/PATCH requests: Test for updating data. Check if the correct status code (200 OK or 204 No Content) is returned.
DELETE requests: Ensure the API deletes data and returns the correct status code (200 OK, 204 No Content).
Validation Tests:

Request body validation: Test invalid or missing parameters in POST or PUT requests. Ensure appropriate error messages and status codes (400 Bad Request).
Request header validation: Check missing or invalid headers, like Content-Type and Authorization.
Query parameter validation: Test for required or optional query parameters (e.g., filtering, pagination).
Authentication & Authorization Tests:

Invalid authentication tokens: Test scenarios where the API is accessed with invalid, expired, or missing tokens. Ensure the server responds with 401 Unauthorized.
Authorization errors: Ensure users with insufficient permissions are restricted from accessing certain resources and return 403 Forbidden.
Error Handling:

Server errors: Simulate internal server errors (e.g., database failure) and check for 500 Internal Server Error responses.
Custom error messages: Ensure that the API returns appropriate error messages in a standardized format, including error codes and descriptive messages.
Edge Cases:

Empty requests: Test for empty request bodies and empty lists in GET responses.
Large payloads: Send large payloads to ensure the API handles it correctly without performance degradation or failures.
Special characters: Test for special characters in inputs to ensure they are handled correctly (e.g., SQL injection prevention, encoding issues).
Performance and Load Testing:

Response times: Ensure that your API performs efficiently and that responses are returned within an acceptable time.
Stress testing: Simulate high traffic (multiple requests per second) to check if the API can handle the load.
Best Practices for API Testing
Use a Dedicated Testing Framework:

Mocha (test framework) combined with Chai (assertion library) is widely used for API testing.
Jest can also be a good option for Node.js testing.
Supertest is a useful tool for making HTTP requests and validating API responses in your test cases.
Example Mocha + Chai + Supertest setup:

const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');  // Your app entry point
const expect = require('chai').expect;

describe('GET /api/items', () => {
    it('should return a list of items', async () => {
        const res = await request(app).get('/api/items');
        expect(res.status).to.equal(200);
        expect(res.body).to.be.an('array');
    });
});
Organize Test Cases:

Group test cases by the type of requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Test different routes and endpoints separately.
Use test fixtures or mock data (e.g., for database records) to maintain consistency.
Test for Response Codes:

Always check for the correct status code (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 500) for all the requests.
A 200 OK status is expected for successful GET requests.
201 Created should be returned for successful POST requests.
Ensure errors return meaningful status codes, like 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, and 500 for server errors.
Use Mocking and Stubbing:

Mock external services or databases to avoid dependence on third-party services during testing. Tools like Sinon.js are helpful for mocking or stubbing functions and services.
If you're using a database, use an in-memory database or mock database responses to isolate the API tests.
Test for Security Vulnerabilities:

Ensure proper handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys).
Verify that user input is sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
Test that your API correctly applies security measures like rate-limiting, input validation, and password hashing.
API Documentation and Contracts:

Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to define API contracts and test your API against them. This ensures consistency between documentation and actual behavior.
Write tests to ensure your API adheres to the defined contract (e.g., using Swagger Validator).
Automate API Tests:

Incorporate API testing into your continuous integration pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI).
Automate your tests to run on every change and catch regressions early.
Data Cleanup:

Always clean up the database after tests, especially when dealing with POST, PUT, or DELETE requests, to maintain a consistent testing environment.
Test Concurrent Requests:

If your API handles concurrency (multiple requests at the same time), make sure to test for race conditions or conflicts.
